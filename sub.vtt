00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.000
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.900
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.800
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.700
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.800
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.800
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.800

I'm in love with the shape of you

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.000
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.600
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.800
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.000
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.300
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.000
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.800
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.500
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.400
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.600
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
